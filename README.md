This project has three main components: the extraction of spectra from the SITELLE data cube, the spectral fitting of the [OII]3727,7319,7330, [NII]5755 and [SIII]6312 features, and the derivation of physical quantities.

spectra_pipeline.ipynb The file extracts spectra from the SITELLE data cubes. This is done using the ORBS Python environment and package, which is the analysis software used for SITELLE observations. The notebook also extracts a background spectrum that is scaled to the number of pixels in each HII regions. The extracted spectra, the wavenumber axis, and the background spectra are all saved.

MUSE+SITELLE_flux_Pipeline.ipynb This file contains the line fitting code for MUSE-PHANGS galaxies with SITELLE data. Faint emission lines, also known as auroral lines, as well as the prominent [OII]3727 flux, known as a nebularl line, are fitted to obtain flux values. The four auroral lines are [OII]7319,7330, [NII]5755, and [SIII]6312. Orgininally the background continuum was not subtracted in the Nebular catalog, so in this notebook I fit the auroral lines with a gaussian with a constant offset to account for the background continuum. The [OII]3737 is fitted using a sinc function provided by the ORBS analysis software. The error in these measurements are calculated using monte carlo techniques.

INIT_PQ_Pipeline.ipynb This file uses PyNeb to compute physical quantities using my refitted auroral lines, the nebular lines from the PHANGS Nebular catalog and the [OII]3727 fluxes from SITELLE. These directly derived physical quantities include [NII], [OII], [SIII] and [OIII] temperatures, [SII] densities, and both elemental and ionic oyxgen abundances.
